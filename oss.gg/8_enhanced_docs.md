**Side Quest**: Enhance Docs

Add a new section to our docs where you see gaps. Dependent on the added value, we will assign points. Make sure to follow the current style of documentation incl. code snippets and screenshots. [Hanko Docs](https://docs.hanko.io) currently covers Quickstart guides for a range of frameworks and some additional content, but honestly they are still lacking context about all the tech and concepts we use to build Hanko. Think about what could be useful information that is currently missing from our docs and add that as a PR to our docs repo (we use Mintlify to host the docs). Using ChatGPT etc. is fine of course but please make sure to check and edit the content for relevance, correctness, and make it on point and concise.

**Points**: 50 - 750 points

**Proof**: Open a PR in our [Docs repo](https://github.com/teamhanko/docs)
