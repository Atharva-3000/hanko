**Challenge**: Technical article covering authentication, passkeys, etc.

Write a technical article that can be posted on our blog (naming you as guest author), e.g.
- Advantages and disadvantages of building a login that uses only passkeys
- How passkey autofill (Conditional UI) works
- Making passwords optional - what’s important when users can delete their passwords?
- Using passkeys as a password replacement vs. for MFA

Just as a general direction for the content. Most of the above can be tried out with different Hanko configurations (MFA coming in Oct). We’re happy to see many other ideas as well.

**Points**: 750 points
